Once that's downloaded extract everything in the .zip file and then you're ready to go!! --> Here's a quick video if you need help!! [Click here](https://youtu.be/ilfi0he_heY)


## Usage

Go to the directory that holds the files from the .zip file you downloaded earlier. When you're in that directory type "npm start" and the program will ask you some questions!!
